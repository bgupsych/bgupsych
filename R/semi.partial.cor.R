#' Partial and Semi-partial correlations
#' @export
#' @description In the Partial correlation, the controlled variable is removed from both DV and UDV,
#' While in Semi-partial, controlled is removed only from the UDV, and so it is very much alike the Beta (direct effect).
#' @details Be sure to understand the theoretical meaning of semi and partial correlation.
#' In a nutshell, both correlate residuals created by a third variable.
#'  Partial correlation is the correlation of two
#'  variables while controlling a third.
#'   SP holds constant the controlled variable only for the UDV (predictor).
#' @seealso \code{\link{ppcor}} for more options.
#' @examples Semi.partial.cor(DV=trees$Height, x.predictor=trees$Volume, x.controlled=trees$Girth)
#' @examples # We correlate Height and Volume, holding Girth constant. In SP it's been removed from only the predicting variable,
#' whilst in partial from both.
#' @note Partial will always be Greater than/Equal to Semi-partial.
#' @returns \code{\link{data.frame}} with the \code{\link{Rsq}} of partial and semipartial, sample size and DF.
